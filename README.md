# Dodge — Simple Chrome Game

A tiny browser game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Move the player left/right to avoid falling blocks.

How to run
1. Save the files `index.html`, `styles.css`, and `script.js` in the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in Chrome (or any other browser).
3. Click "Start Game" and play.
   - Controls: Left / Right arrow keys or A / D, or touch 

Notes
- Score increases for each block you successfully dodge.
- High score is stored in localStorage.
- This uses JavaScript (not Java). Modern browsers do not support Java applets.
- Feel free to tweak spawn rate, player speed and styles in `script.js` and `styles.css`.
